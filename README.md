## Project Type
Type A

## Project Description
Use GitHub and GitHub Actions/Workflow, same as in the lecture and many more. We use Sonarqube to check if there are problems with bugs and vulnerabilities in our code. We also create an automatic release in Github.

Read world examples / usecases:
- [x] (1) A developer wants to merge a feature branch into the master branch. Sonarqube is used to check the code quality and block the merge if this pipeline fails. Notification is generated and will be send to the user.
- [x] (2) There is a new version on the release branch. Versioning in Github with tags and also artifacts (image) is rolled out on Docker automatically.
- [x] (3) Hotfix is detected and subsequently update with versions on all specified apps are released in corresponding version (major minor patch).
- [x] (4) After a change on major and minor level the changelog / readme file should be updated with additional information about it. 
- [x] (5) Automatically download data source(s), preprocess and clean them and store them in the repo (incl. versioning) => Data sets in our repositories should be downloaded automatically (e.g. from a url) and versioned as well. The data can be updated e.g. automatically every six months. The data should then be cleansed with R in order to be able to work with it immediately / easily.
- [x] (6) A developer wants to merge a update into master branch. A code linter should automatically start after creating pull request und start to lint the code. Information about linter status should be visual in the Readme file.

Images in the form of sequence diagrams (as they were also presented in the exercise in the chapter GitFlow) should be created to visualize the usecases in detail.

### Summary of research
We discovered that Github Actions can be very vercitile and be applied to many different fields. An example for software engineering in our project would be the code validation with sonar cube. An example for a use of Data Sience is to version your data like described in use case 5. But during our research we hat also a glimbse at many other possibilities where Github actions are already used.

Also we found that writing actions yourself is not that complicated and easy to use. It's especially impressive how much can be achived with very a rather small yaml snippet. But we also expirienced that exchanging data between workflows is not possible since the data has to be saved in repository before another workflow can use it. Also you have to be very careful with automatically merging branches because it can have sometimes some unexpected behaviour.

GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want. Kick off workflows with GitHub events like push, issue creation, or a new release. Combine and configure actions for the services you use, built and maintained by the community. 

Whether you want to build a container, deploy a web service, or automate welcoming new users to your open source projectsâ€”there's an action for that. Pair GitHub Packages with Actions to simplify package management, including version updates, fast distribution with our global CDN, and dependency resolution, using your existing GITHUB_TOKEN. GitHub Actions connects all of your tools to automate every step of your development workflow. Easily deploy to any cloud, create tickets in Jira, or publish a package to npm.

### Summary of lessons-learned

:tada: We worked great as a team. Especially working via pair programming and scrum helped us a lot with Yak Shaving difficulties.

:gift: In general the majority of the github actions and github workflows are well document.

:mortar_board: Git Actions are really cool and there are almost infinite cases which can be applied.

:bulb: Workflow jobs can based on predefined Github actions and adapted by command line code snippets.

:information_source: Similar functions like Github Action are also available other services like Gitlab.

:white_check_mark: We covered all use cases in our project which harmonize very well.

:x: No good documentation for changelog integration.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Do not forget to address secrets and use the right name.

:bangbang: Be careful with cyclic running workflows. Do not create an endless cycle.


### Demonstrate advantages gained by Cloud Computing

With the automation that the GitHub workflows provide, it is easy to save a lot of time and resources. Having the possibility to utilize contiuous intergration and contiuous delivery for automatically building, testing, and deploying projects, without having to worry about local setups is essential. GitHub allows Linux-, Windows-, and macOS-environments for the cloud based runners that execute the workflows. 

Cloud Computing makes it easy to choose the needed environment without any problems. Nevertheless it is also possible to self-host runners in your own data center or cloud infrastructure. Because of this cloud-based approach, the data that has to be exchanged between the jobs or steps of a workflow does not have to be temporarily saved locally. It can be swapped between the components, as long as the runners are still active. Things like code-checks can be done in one place and the people that work on a repository do not have to set up everything locally.

## Last information

Just do it ;) (use GitHub Actions)
