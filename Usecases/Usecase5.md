## Details

Automatically download data source(s), preprocess and clean them and store them in the repo (incl. versioning) => Data sets in our repositories should be downloaded automatically (e.g. from a url) and versioned as well. The data can be updated e.g. automatically every six months. The data should then be cleansed with R in order to be able to work with it immediately / easily.
