```
name: Check with Sonar
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
jobs:
  sonarcloud:
    name: SonarCloud
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  
          
      - name: SonarCloud Scan
        uses: SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OUR_GITHUB_TOKEN }}  
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Send mail
        if: always()
        uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v2
        with:
          server_address: smtp.gmail.com
          server_port: 465
          secure: true

          username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}

          subject: ${{ github.job }} job of ${{ github.repository }} has ${{ job.status }}
          body: ${{ github.job }} job in worflow ${{ github.workflow }} of ${{ github.repository }} has ${{ job.status }}
          to: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
          from: CLC3 Gitflow
```

### How to prevent merging with errors in sonar
Go to 'Settings' --> 'Branches' --> 'Add rule'

Branch name pattern: "master"

Check 'Require status checks to pass before merging' on and search in the searchbar for 'SonarCloud Code Analysis' and click on it.

## How to start the workflow
Starts with a pull-request on the master branch, when the pull-request is either opened, synchronized or repopened
